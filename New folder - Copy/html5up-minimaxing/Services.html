                            Problematic anger is defined as anger which is more frequent, longer duration, or of greater intensity than expected. Problematic anger causes difficulties in relationships, employment or with the legal system.

                        <p>
                            Treating anxiety is a two-step process. The first step is to identify the anxiety symptoms and learn new ways to manage them. This is done by learning relaxation techniques and by identifying and changing the faulty thought patterns that contribute to the anxious feelings. The second step is to implement the relaxation and thought-stopping techniques. The use of visualization is also added for clients dealing with specific phobias.

                            Symptoms of depression include feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness; loss of interest in activities, changes to appetite or sleep patterns, increased irritability, increased distractedness, and loss of concentration. People experiencing depression experience some (or even all) of these symptoms to varying degrees. Psychotherapy has been proven to be crucial in the recovery from depression.</p>

                            People do not usually have a lot of conflicts in their relationships; they tend to have the same conflicts repeatedly. Through couples counseling, issues which contribute to conflicts are addressed and resolved. Couples are educated about more effective communication styles, problem-solving skills, and active listening skills. This results in healthier relationships and increased life satisfaction.
